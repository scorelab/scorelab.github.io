We are a dynamic and enthusiastic nonprofit research group pioneering in Computer Security, and Software Tools, and is one of the best groups in South Asia. This is the 6th time that we are participating in the GSoC, we will use this page to develop possible project ideas that have on the above mentioned areas. Please note that anyone who is interested can participate in this process. You do not have to be a GSoC student or mentor to suggest possible project ideas. You can also talk to us about possible project ideas and we are happy to improve or heip you with them.
